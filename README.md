Car-Hub-1.0 is a fully responsive car shop website designed to work seamlessly across all devices. The site features a navigation bar, a banner, and a collection of cars from various brands. Users can view detailed information about each car by clicking the "Show Details" button on the car card, which leads to a page with comprehensive details and a "Book Now" button to add the car to their booking list. The booking list can be accessed via the navigation bar, showing the number of cars booked. Additionally, the website includes statistics on car sales from previous years and a contact list of employees for easy communication. The project extensively uses React.js for a dynamic and interactive user experience. Furthermore, the site integrates Firebase authentication for secure user login and registration, ensuring that only authenticated users can book cars and access personalized features.
